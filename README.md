# My Story üìù
   Talking about my story, I am the guy who is fully Ambitious, Altruistic, Autodidactic i.e. follows 3A's in his life. I worked so hard from my second Year of Engineering when I explored myself with students of the same age as mine was doing so much stuff. I am a guy who just hates to lose in any condition. The only thing motivates me is, I just want to see myself on top-positon in my field and help students in my field for Better and Ambitious Youths.
   When I was in the second year I literally don't know any Programming language, any Tech-Stack I don't even know how to create an Object of class in C++. But fortunately, I met our college faculty Bag Sir and Jaspreet Maam, and where it was started, "One student, One Teacher, One Book, One Pen can change the world ". 
   Then I started exploring myself, gone through too many rough times, downfalls, late-night studies, and many more sacrifices. In my difficult time, I used to watch Ronaldo's Motivational Stories because he is my role model and keeping "To be in my shoes is not easy" in my mind. I am the only guy who got 49, 50, and 48 marks out of 50 in Engineering Mathematics Subjects(M-1, M-2, M-3) in my Engineering.
   My college faculties, My family, and My Friend continuously motivate me during my downfalls, and that's why I am here today.
   
   
# Why I am interested in building communities? üòÉ
- As we know learning something new in any field from scratch is so painful and difficult because in that condition you have created your own path, you have to overcome difficulties in your path without losing hope and I felt this kind of situation.
- That's why I really want to build and grow a community that will help students like me who are completely beginner to any Tech-Stack in Computer and IT industry and teaches them in an easy, simple, and joyful manner, not as a TEACHER as a FRIEND.
- Because nowadays we can see there are tons of resources available on Internet but finding which is suitable, appropriate and matching synergy with them is so tedious and difficult that's why I   am so eager to build my own Community which will reach out to every Tech and Non-Tech Enthusiast and makes their Career path easier. Not only sharing the Technical Knowledge but also some motivational speech, how to live life to the fullest, and many more...
- According to me, Community is nothing but a Group of peoples having thirst for learning something new and sharing it with the next person. I have a strong desire of helping students from the depth of my heart as my father is a teacher and we know Like father, like son: every good tree makes good fruits so I also want to step ahead like my father only with the help of Community. 

# Community Definition üí≠
- As I said Earlier Community is nothing but Group of peoples having thirst for learning something new and sharing it to the next person.
- My aim is not building only Specific Interest or only Tech related groups instead My club will depend on members to member interests and their opinions.
- My club's success is directly proportional to the satisfaction of our club members.
- I will try to make my community which will be formally recognized community. Very first I will form a small network of highly passionate students and members as a base or main pillar of our community and then will spread this network to various regions as well. Also, our community will exist until our members are satisfying because In the end community is mainly depend on its members, not on an individual human being. We will try to reach out as many as students from around the globe and grow the community further.

# Community's shared struggles ‚ú®
- To make the community stronger, relations with members should be stronger and to make relations stronger we will share thoughts of each and every community members as well as time to time feedbacks, suggestions, improvements, and many more...
- Instead of making only teaching and learning relationships, we will build family-type relationships among our group members. We will treat each member as a family member of our community.
-  We will try to share any personal or non-personal problems, issues, obstacles like financial problems, academics problems, and resolving them promptly.
-   I am damn sure by using this methodology we will build strong relations with our community members and eventually it turns into the strongest community.   

# Community Mission  üîñ
### NewPros - ``` We believe in transforming NEWbies into PROfessionals, nevertheless of Field, Profession, Interest, Designation. ```
<br>

# What do members look to get from our community?ü§î
### 1. Activities
- First of all, we would love to conduct various workshops, seminars, meetups in order to make the basics and concepts of members stronger than ever.
- After this we will conduct an assessment test on taken workshops, seminars to detect where members are lagging behind and which points and areas of the particular field should consider making them feel better with preferred topics, fields.
- After the workshops and seminars, we will mainly focus on making various and unique projects from group members because this is the only way to test and apply knowledge gained before.
- We will also try to make Industrial Sponsored Projects because in the end it will be beneficial for all members and will shine among other competitors in placements and interviews.
- We will also love to conduct Hackathons, Coding contests, and summer of code programs too. Because I have experience of Organizing hackathons that were held at our campus having 24-Hours of the hackathon with Prize pool of Rs. 50,000/-.
-  And after doing all this procedure we are happy to conclude that we are successfully and strongly adhere to our Community Mission.

### 2. Communication
- We will use all social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Telegram, Mailing system, WhatsApp.
- Apart from this, we will try to keep in touch continuously with members through various communications channels like Gitter, Slack, Spectrum, Forums, IRC, Medium.
- I am also a group leader of NewPros on Mozilla so we will communicate with each other on that group regarding the latest trending topics, new and popular technologies that would be helpful for career growth.

# Future-Proofing of our community ‚úîÔ∏è

### 1. Agency
- Even if I become GitHub Campus Expert I will treat myself as a member of our community.
-  We will first build detailed planning about various tasks that have to be done by our community and divide the roles for each task according to the interest of members.
 > For Ex.  Some of the community members like to do Digital Promotion, someone just loved to conduct non-technical activities, someone like to do only technical related activities.  

- We will also make a team that will track the Progress Rate of each Community members.
- After dividing roles we will also track that where a particular member is following his role if not then help him to do his role better.
- According to me, this procedure will definitely build leadership and responsibility skill in members.

#### In short keeping happy, healthy Workspace :)

### 2. Mission
- The mission is a very important thing where I give a success rate of Specific Community.
- We believe in ROI(Return On Investment).
-  Investment in our case is only a member's precious time and Return is nothing but members satisfactions nothing else.
-   We will consider the needs of all individuals in delivering their services.
-  And for new Community Leader, we will spend some time with time in order to give him ideas about community works, what are steps that have to be taken for the betterment of the community and also accessible to the Missions, Visions, and goals of Community.

### 3. Structure üìà
- Introducing our Community and its Missions, Visions, and Goals.
- Detailed Plans and various roles of Community members.
- Gap or Mistake Analysis, Progress, and Growth Rate of members.
- While choosing our successor, I will look for candidates who have some synergy with our members. Because if synergy is matched then it will be beneficial for the leader to get access to Community structure, the mission quickly.
- I will also consider candidates who are willing to make sound decisions on our Community behalf.
- Unless New Community leaders fit accessible with the Community I will make myself available for advice.
- I will talk regularly and address issues that arise by New Leaders as well as Community members and Focus on continuity.
- I will try to share information on processes, and why things are done that way.
- Also keep track of New Leader's roles, their responsibilities, performance, Growth rate and will give suggestions from time to time.
